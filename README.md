## Space shooting Game

This is a 2 player space shooting game made in my free time by seeing a tutorial ofcourse :)

To play this game follow the below steps:

Clone this repo  
Do "pip install pygame" (For me it didn't install directly don't know why. So I created a virtual env and installed)  
and run main file "python3 main.py"
