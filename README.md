## Space shooting Game

This is a 2 player space shooting game made in my free time by seeing a tutorial ofcourse :)

To play this game follow the below steps:

1. Clone this repo </br>
2. Do "pip install pygame" - For me it didn't install directly don't know why(Could be skill issueðŸ« ). So I created a virtual env and installed </br>
3. Run main file "python3 main.py"
